Today, more HTML and CSS, 
rel is a to "< link >"

The components of an url:
eg. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US

<protocol><domain>(<port>)<path>

1: protocol:https-> which is not the TCP/IP
2: domain: developer.mozilla.org -> used to ask for the DNS server and translate to ip address (192.168.1.2)
3: port: 443 
4: path: en-US

difference between html <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_id.asp" target = "_blank" >id and class</a>
